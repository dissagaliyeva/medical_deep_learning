    "In this week's assignment, you'll be working with 3D MRI brain scans from the public [Medical Segmentation Decathlon](https://decathlon-10.grand-challenge.org/) challenge project. This is an incredibly rich dataset that provides you with labels associated with each point (voxel) inside a 3D representation of a patient's brain. Ultimately, in this week's assignment, you will train a neural network to make three-dimensional spatial segmentation predictions for common brain disorders.\n",

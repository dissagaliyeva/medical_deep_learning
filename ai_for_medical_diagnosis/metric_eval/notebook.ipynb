    "# Evaluation of Diagnostic Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second assignment of course 1. In this assignment, we will be working with the results of the X-ray classification model we developed in the previous assignment. In order to make the data processing a bit more manageable, we will be working with a subset of our training, and validation datasets. We will also use our manually labeled test dataset of 420 X-rays.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, our dataset contains X-rays from 14 different conditions diagnosable from an X-ray. We'll evaluate our performance on each of these classes using the classification metrics we learned in lecture.\n",
